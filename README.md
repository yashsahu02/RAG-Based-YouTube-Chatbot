## 1. Introduction
The RAG-Based YouTube Chatbot project utilizes a conversational AI framework to provide answers to user queries based directly on a video's transcript. The tool is designed to offer a reliable and context-aware Q&A experience by preventing the AI model from generating information outside of the provided content.

## 2. Features
- A web application built with the Streamlit framework that allows users to ask questions about a YouTube video.
- Utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide answers directly from a video's transcript, preventing hallucinations.
- The application processes transcripts in English and Hindi, providing a responsive and accurate conversational experience.
- Developed using LangChain and the Google Generative AI API for efficient document loading and model integration.
